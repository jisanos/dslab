# Benchmarking DYTAS

This fork of DSLab also contains result files and analysis for my thesis which compares DYTAS, Dynamic List, and HEFT. This fork has an implementation of DYTAS (Amalarethinam & Mary, 2011) which I added to the framework for the sake of benchmarking it. During implementation of it, variants were created, hence criterias specified to it before execution change its behavior.

The repository also contains other rust packages (dag-export and dag-stats) that allowed me to analyze the data accurately based on how DSLab processed it.

# DSLab
